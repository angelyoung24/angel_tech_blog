Hello! My name is Angel. I want to talk about what lead me to want to transition into tech.

My journey to tech started back in 2000. It was my first exposure to the internet. While I didn't have the internet at home, my high school had the internet and I would spend time on the internet looking up content on my favorite TV shows.

I also saw that my friends were making their own webpages and I wanted to join in. I made a webpage using the former website Homestead. Then I branched off making a Mandy Moore fansite using Homestead and a fansite about the Canadian teen soap opera Edgemont using Lycos/Angelfire. Only the Edgemont page is still up. These pages were made with templates and no real coding took place that I remembered

In 2004 in my last year of high school, my best friend introduced me to MySpace. That was the first time I dabbled in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). I would decorate my site with these annoying pink sparkles and I thought it was the coolest thing in the world.
